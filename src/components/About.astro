    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div>
      <div>Hello, and welcome to my corner of the web!</div>

      <div>
        I am a technology enthusiast with a focus on web development and
        open-source contributions. My journey in the tech world has been filled
        with many exciting challenges and continuous learning. Back in 2005, I
        built my first computer. Later that year, I began writing plugins for a
        very popular game Counter-Strike. A year later, I enrolled in college
        for Software Engineering and that's when I feel in love with
        programming. Since then, I have continuously written programs, honing my
        programming skills. I read a lot of technical books and actively
        participate in coding platforms to enhance my existing skills and
        acquire new ones. Some of these resources can be found further down on
        this page. As of today, I have developed programs using a variety of
        programming languages. The projects I create range from Linux
        applications to websites. I am always looking for a challenge and love
        working on projects that can make a difference in today's world. I am
        always eager to expand my horizons by taking on new projects,
        particularly those that change the world for the better. I believe we
        should all strive to make the world a better place, and what better way
        than by creating software that enhances our lives!

      <h3>Books</h3>

      <div>
        I value empirical evidence, exploring concepts from books to gauge their
        practicality in real world. The following books have significantly
        influenced my perspective on software engineering.
      </div>

      <h2>Projects</h2>

      <div>
        Below are some of the projects I've been working on. If you have a
        project and need assistance, feel free to send me a message!
      </div>

      <h3>Blockchain</h3>

      <div>
        I love to learn and explore, so I wrote a blockchain in TypeScript for
        fun. Explore the code at <a
          href="https://github.com/exilesprx/blockchain">blockchain</a
        >.
      </div>

      <h3>Linux</h3>

      <div>
        I always ran Linux, but not on my main desktop or laptop. That changed
        in 2023. I decided to leave Windows and immerse myself in Linux because
        I've always loved it. Gaming has been the only blocker. However, gaming
        on Linux has gotten much better, so I took the plunge and I don't regret
        it one bit!
      </div>

      <div>
        While you might not see projects explicitly related to Linux, I am
        always focused on learning anything Linux.
      </div>

      <h2>Educational</h2>

      <h3>Haskell</h3>

      <div>
        I recently delved into pure functional programming with my first
        language of choice being Haskell. I aim to explore a pure functional
        language and understand its benefits. Check out
        <a href="https://github.com/exilesprx/vigilant-carnival"
          >vigilant carnival</a
        >.
      </div>

      <h3>Exercism, Advent of Code, Project Euler</h3>

      <div>
        I enjoy using each listed platform to learn new languages. They provide
        interesting and challenging problems to work through. Sometimes, you
        learn more than just a programming language!
      </div>

      <h2>Tech Stack</h2>

      <div>
        I enjoy working with a variety of technologies. Here are some of my
        favorites:
