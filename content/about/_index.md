# Welcome!

Hello, and welcome to my corner of GitHub!

## About Me

I am a technology enthusiast with a focus on web development and open-source contributions. My journey in the tech world has been filled with many exciting challenges and continuous learning.

## My Projects

Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

### Haskell

I recently delved into pure functional programming with my first language of choice being Haskell. I aim to explore a pure functional language and understand its benefits. Check out [vigilant-carnival](https://github.com/exilesprx/vigilant-carnival).

### Blockchain

I love to learn and explore, so I wrote a blockchain in TypeScript for fun. Explore the code at [blockchain](https://github.com/exilesprx/blockchain).

### Linux

I always ran Linux, but not on my main desktop or laptop. That changed in 2023. I decided to leave Windows and immerse myself in Linux because I've always loved it. Gaming has been the only blocker. However, gaming on Linux has gotten much better, so I took the plunge and I don't regret it one bit!

While you might not see projects explicitly related to Linux, I am always focused on learning anything Linux.

### Exercism, Advent of Code, Project Euler

I enjoy using each listed platform to learn new languages. They provide interesting and challenging problems to work through. Sometimes, you learn more than just a programming language!

## Tech Stack

I enjoy working with a variety of technologies. Here are some of my favorites:

- **Languages:** PHP, Haskell, Go, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Bash
- **Database:** MySQL, Event Store
- **Other:** Docker, Node, RabbitMQ

I also read many books and usually apply what I read to different projects to test out various concepts and theories. Domain-Driven Design (DDD) has played a significant role in my life for a few years. I like exploring those concepts to see how practical they are in the real world.

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:exiles.prx@gmail.com) if you'd like to collaborate on a project or just chat about technology.

Happy coding!
