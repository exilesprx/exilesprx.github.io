Hello, and welcome to my corner of the web!

## About Me

I am a technology enthusiast with a focus on web development and open-source contributions. My journey in the tech world has been filled with many exciting challenges and continuous learning.

Back in 2005, I built my first computer. Later that year, I began writing plugins for a very popular game Counter-Strike. A year later, I enrolled in college for Software Engineering and that's when I feel in love with programming.

Since then, I have continuously written programs, honing my programming skills. I read a lot of technical books and actively participate in coding platforms to enhance my existing skills and acquire new ones. Some of these resources can be found further down on this page.

As of today, I have developed programs using a variety of programming languages. The projects I create range from Linux applications to websites. I am always looking for a challenge and love working on projects that can make a difference in today's world.

I am always eager to expand my horizons by taking on new projects, particularly those that change the world for the better. I believe we should all strive to make the world a better place, and what better way than by creating software that enhances our lives!

- Domain Driven Design
- Implementing Domain Driven Design
- Growing Object-Oriented Software
- A Philosophy of Software Design
- Building Microservices
- Modern Software Engineering
- Clean Code
- Team Topologies
- Design Patterns
- Project Phoenix

## Projects

Below are some of the projects I've been working on. If you have a project and need assistance, feel free to send me a message!

### Blockchain

I love to learn and explore, so I wrote a blockchain in TypeScript for fun. Explore the code at [blockchain](https://github.com/exilesprx/blockchain).

### Linux

I always ran Linux, but not on my main desktop or laptop. That changed in 2023. I decided to leave Windows and immerse myself in Linux because I've always loved it. Gaming has been the only blocker. However, gaming on Linux has gotten much better, so I took the plunge and I don't regret it one bit!

While you might not see projects explicitly related to Linux, I am always focused on learning anything Linux.

## Educational

### Haskell

I recently delved into pure functional programming with my first language of choice being Haskell. I aim to explore a pure functional language and understand its benefits. Check out [vigilant-carnival](https://github.com/exilesprx/vigilant-carnival).

### Exercism, Advent of Code, Project Euler

I enjoy using each listed platform to learn new languages. They provide interesting and challenging problems to work through. Sometimes, you learn more than just a programming language!

## Tech Stack

I enjoy working with a variety of technologies. Here are some of my favorites:

- **Languages:** PHP, Haskell, Go, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Bash
- **Database:** MySQL, Event Store
- **Other:** Docker, Node, RabbitMQ

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:exiles.prx@gmail.com) if you'd like to collaborate on a project or just chat about technology.

Happy coding!
